# Data quality issues/choices
- This data will not include things which are sub-sub units. So, it does not include extension.
- The dates in VERSO only have the calendar year, so I'll just have to pick which fiscal year those go into, or do multiple analyses.
- This data does not include non-degree student enrollment

# az database list
- cross-ref with platform list somehow

# fall enrollment
- take college-level sums of enrollment
- add primary identifier (college + fy)
- merge with spring enrollment dataframe
